TODO:
Design a minimal working model
Pick a sport/stat and outline exact features
Talk about correlation modeling for parlays
Sketch a full system architecture (data → model → dashboard)


Dats Source:
NBA Stats API to get player data (updated after games tho)
from nba_api.stats.endpoints import playergamelogs
# Set up daily cron job to pull previous day's games

Storage:
PostgreSQL for relational game logs (easy querying by player/date)
Supabase (free tier, PostgreSQL-based, has Python SDK)
Schema: games, player_stats, team_stats, betting_lines

Getting book odds:
The Odds API - Legitimate, paid API (~$15/month) that aggregates lines from DraftKings, FanDuel, etc.
Web scraping PrizePicks/Underdog - Use Selenium/Playwright since they're JavaScript-heavy
 - Consider rotating proxies to avoid IP bans
